# HR Analytics - Employee Attrition Prediction

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand the key factors contributing to employee attrition and building a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can support data-driven retention strategies.

**Objectives**

- Analyze workforce data to identify patterns and drivers of employee attrition
- Explore relationships between satisfaction, workload, performance, tenure, and compensation
- Build a predictive model to improve attrition prediction accuracy

**Key Insights**

- Employee attrition is strongly influenced by satisfaction level, number of projects, monthly working hours, and tenure
- Employees with very high workloads or very low satisfaction show significantly higher attrition rates
- Feature engineering and balanced data substantially improve prediction performance

**Approach**

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations
- Engineered features using binning and behavioral grouping to capture non-linear patterns
- Addressed class imbalance to improve model reliability
- Evaluated model performance using classification metrics and baseline comparisons

**Results**
- Improved attrition prediction accuracy by approximately 20% compared to a baseline model
- Identified high-risk employee segments to support proactive retention decisions

**Future Improvements**

- Incorporate additional employee engagement and compensation features
- Experiment with advanced ensemble models

Deploy the model as a dashboard or API for real-time HR decision support
